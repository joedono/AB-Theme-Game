## Theme - Lunch Box
The theme is technically either Bento Box or just Food in general. That leaves a lot of options for a game for next year. I could go with the old Burger Time formula and make something sort of like Tetris where burger parts fall from the top of the screen and the player has to make sandwiches with them. I could do something akin to Overcooked where the player has to complete a couple of mundane tasks in a time limit. I could bring back Sweet Sorting and make a game kind of like that sorting game in Wreck-It Ralph, or the one where you feed cake to the rabbit and pancakes to the cat. I could try for Cooking Mama, where it's all about the timing. I could create any other genre and just skin it with food. I feel like it might be better to actually make the game about food. Maybe I can get some inspiration from an anime. The three most popular food anime I know of are Yakitate Japan, Toriko, and Food Wars. Yakitate and Food Wars are actually about cooking, so a game where you put some sort of meal together would fit those. Toriko is about venturing out into the dangerous wilds in search of rare ingredients. I could use that to make a few different types of games.
